## Credits
I used the W3Schools webpage to research vector pecifications and hexidecimal color code index.
<https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp>
I had some help with figuring out the hexidecimal representation and validation from Ryan Spath <https://github.com/CodeByDex> and Zach Mutch<https://github.com/that-devguy?tab=repositories>.
